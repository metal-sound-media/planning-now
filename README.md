# Planning Now

Load event from a CSV file and display it into an HTML page.

You can also parse the JSON from _planning.php_ with an OBS extension like [OBS URL/API Source](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-urlsource).

For the images, you can use _planning-image.php_ as a browser source on OBS.
The image is refreshed every 30s. 
You can use the query parameter _when_ with value `now` or `after` in order to get the good image.

## How to use it?

Fill the events into the CSV file: planning.csv

**/!\ Don't change the name of the file.**
